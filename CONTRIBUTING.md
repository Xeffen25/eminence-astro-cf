## Naming conventions

We follow common React naming conventions for filenames, component names, classes, constants, and more.

- For component **filenames** and **class names**, always use `PascalCase`.
- For **non-component filenames**, always use fully lowercase `kebab-case`.
- For **test filenames**, append `.test` before the file extension.
- When declaring **instances** of components, always use `camelCase`.
- When declaring **exported constants**, always use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

| &nbsp;                       | âœ… Valid                                  | ðŸš« Invalid                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Component filenames:**     | `CardTitle.tsx`<br>`CardTitle.tsx`        | `cardTitle.tsx`<br>`card_title.tsx`<br>`card-title.tsx`                                 |
| **Non-component filenames:** | `utility.ts`<br>`process-data.ts`         | `Utility.ts`<br>`processData.ts`<br>`process_data.ts`                                   |
| **Test filenames:**          | `DataValidator.test.tsx`                  | `DataValidator-test.tsx`<br>`DataValidator_test.tsx`<br>`DataValidatorTest.tsx`         |
| **Component classes:**       | `<DisplayPanel />`                        | `<displayPanel />`                                                                      |
| **Component instances:**     | `const contentFilter = <ContentFilter />` | `const ContentFilter = <ContentFilter />`<br>`const content_filter = <ContentFilter />` |
| **Exported constants:**      | `export const MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 10;`     | `export const MaxFileSizeMB = 10;`<br>`export const max_file_size_mb = 10;`             |

### Commit naming

Conventional Commits are a lightweight commit message convention for creating an explicit commit history, facilitating automated tooling and aligning with SemVer. Key elements include:

- **Structure:** `<type>[optional scope]: <description> [optional body] [optional footer(s)]`
- **Types:** `fix`, `feat`, `BREAKING CHANGE`, and others.
- **SemVer Correlation:** `fix` (PATCH), `feat` (MINOR), `BREAKING CHANGE` (MAJOR).

## Changesets

If you are contributing a user-facing or noteworthy change to this project that should be added to the changelog, you should include a changeset with your PR by running the following command.

| Command                 | Description             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `npm run changeset add` | Add a changeset locally |

Follow the prompts to select whether the change is a major, minor or patch change. This will create a file in the `.changesets` directory of the repo. This change should be committed and included with your PR.

**Considerations:**

- You can use markdown in your changeset to include code examples, headings, and more. However, **please use plain text for the first line of your changeset**. The formatting of the GitHub release notes does not support headings as the first line of the changeset.

## Merging PRs

When merging PRs, please select the **Squash and Merge** option, which consolidates all the changes from the PR into a single commit. This helps reduce the commit noise in our Git repository.
